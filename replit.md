## Authentication

The app uses Replit Auth (OIDC) for authentication:

- **Landing Page** (`/`) - Shown to unauthenticated users with "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons
- **Login Flow** - `/api/login` initiates OIDC auth, `/api/callback` handles the redirect
- **Logout** - `/api/logout` ends session and redirects to landing
- **Protected Routes** - All API routes use `isAuthenticated` middleware
- **User Session** - Stored in PostgreSQL `sessions` table with automatic token refresh

**Key Auth Files:**
- `server/replitAuth.ts` - OIDC middleware setup
- `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - React hook for auth state
- `client/src/pages/Landing.tsx` - Public landing page

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query v5
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **AI**: OpenAI API (configured, not yet integrated)

## Design Guidelines

- Dark theme enabled by default
- Teal primary color (hue 180)
- Inter font family
- All components use shadcn/ui primitives
- Follows universal design guidelines in design_guidelines.md

## Running the App

The workflow "Start application" runs `npm run dev` which starts both:
- Express backend server
- Vite frontend dev server

App is served on port 5000.

## Mock Data Locations

Files containing mock data (marked with "todo: remove mock functionality"):
- Dashboard.tsx - Weight data, metrics
- DietaryTracking.tsx - Meal logs, food search
- Progress.tsx - Achievement data
- Fasting.tsx - Timer state
- Coach.tsx - Chat messages
- AICoachChat.tsx - AI responses
- FoodSearch.tsx - Food database
- ResearchHub.tsx - Article content
- WeeklyReflection.tsx - AI insights

## Next Steps for Backend Implementation

1. Create database schema in shared/schema.ts:
   - users (profiles, preferences)
   - weight_logs (daily weight entries)
   - meals (food logs with macros)
   - fasting_sessions (fasting history)
   - daily_goals (win tracking)
   - streaks (streak data)
   - chat_messages (AI conversation history)

2. Implement API routes in server/routes.ts

3. Connect OpenAI for AI coaching responses

4. Integrate real food database API
